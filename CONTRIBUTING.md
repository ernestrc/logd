# How to contribute

Logd is MIT licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests.
This document outlines some of the conventions on commit message formatting,
contact points for developers, and other resources to help get contributions
into Logd.

# Email and chat

- Email: [logd](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/logd-development)
- Gitter: TODO

## Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the README.md for build instructions

## Reporting bugs and creating issues

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute.

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. This is usually master.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the main repository.

Thanks for contributing!
